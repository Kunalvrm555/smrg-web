Hydrogen production from biomass represents a sustainable approach to generating clean energy. By utilizing agricultural residues and other organic waste materials, we aim to reduce waste and produce hydrogen, which can serve as a clean fuel for various applications. The project involves the development of catalytic systems that enhance the efficiency of the gasification and pyrolysis processes. Ongoing work includes the study of catalyst behavior under different operational conditions and the scale-up of successful lab-scale processes to pilot implementations.
