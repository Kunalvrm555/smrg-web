The project addresses the need for environmentally friendly emission control technologies in the automotive industry. We are developing and testing new catalytic materials that can replace expensive platinum-group metals traditionally used in catalytic converters. Our approach involves synthesizing and characterizing various metal oxides and studying their efficacy in breaking down pollutants at low temperatures.
