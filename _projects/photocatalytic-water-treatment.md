Utilizing the power of photocatalysis, we aim to degrade harmful pollutants in wastewater using sunlight. The project involves the synthesis of novel photocatalysts and their application in real-world wastewater treatment scenarios. The goal is to achieve high degradation efficiency while using solar energy, making the process sustainable and cost-effective.
