The recovery of precious metals from industrial waste not only addresses the issue of waste management but also mitigates the need for new mining operations. Our research is centered on the use of novel chemical processes and materials to efficiently extract metals such as gold, silver, and platinum from electronic waste and other metal-rich waste streams. Current efforts include optimizing the extraction processes to increase yield and reduce energy consumption.
